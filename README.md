# School District Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The city school district requires to prepare all standardized test data for analysis, reporting and presentation. The outcome will be used to provide insights about performance trends and patterns for its schools. These insights will be taken into discussions and help in making strategic decisions regarding school budgets/priorities at the school/district levels by the school board and superintendent.

After the initial analysis, there was a report of academic dishonesty with evidence for the ninth grade in Thomas high school. With this in consideration an additional analysis was required with 7 key metrics excluding Thomas high school ninth grade for reading and math. As part of the analysis one additional requirement was to understand the impact of this exclusion to the metrics.
